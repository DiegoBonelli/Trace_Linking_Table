## R Code to link Trace to CRSP

We create a linking table that matches bond issues from TRACE to firms in CRSP. 

To create a bond-firm linking table, we use Mergent FISD bondsâ€™ 9-digit CUSIPs to get issuer and parent CUSIPs for each bond and we also use TRACE-reported trading symbols, which are firm-level tickers, and company names. 
The PDF files details the whole procedure.
